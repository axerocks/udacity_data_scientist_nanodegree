## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

You'll need to install PySpark library. All other standard libraries such as numpy,pandas, matplotlib, and scikit learn are needed as well. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
To identify the users that could potentially cancel their account and leave the service. By identifying this population upfront, we could incentivize them by giving them discounts or other rewards. This could make them stick, giving us a loyal customer base which is key for a companyâ€™s growth. 

In addition, I was personally interested in learning and applying Spark technology to the problem that's very relevant in today's scenario. However, this analysis was done on a small subset of data.
