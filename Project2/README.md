Project Motivation
For this project, I used a dataset from Kaggle which was originally scraped from Wish E-Commerce Platform. It contains product listings, products ratings, sales performance, and merchant/supplier information if you type "Summer" in the search field of the platform.

I was interested in answering the following questions:

What are the top selling categories, product size and colors for Summer?
Which key variables/factors successfully predict the number of units sold?
Can you build a machine learning model to predict the number of units sold?
File Descriptions
There is just one single notebook here to showcase work related to answer the above questions. This notebook has markdown cells to guide or walk-thru the thought process for each and every individual step. In addition, the data used for analysis and modeling was loaded as ".csv" file.

Here's the link to actual data source:
