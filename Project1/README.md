## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
For this project, I used a dataset from Kaggle which was originally scraped from Wish E-Commerce Platform. It contains product listings, products ratings, sales performance, and merchant/supplier information if you type "Summer" in the search field of the platform.
I was interested in answering the following questions:
1. What are the top selling categories, product size and colors for Summer?
2. Which key variables/factors successfully predict the number of units sold?
3. Can you build a machine learning model to predict the number of units sold?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
There is just one single notebook here to showcase work related to answer the above questions. This notebook has markdown cells to guide or walk-thru the thought process for each and every individual step. In addition, the data used for analysis and modeling was loaded as ".csv" file.
